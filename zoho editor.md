# Scope of work

Life expectancy is one of the most important factors in end-of-life decision making. Good prognostication for example helps to determine the course of treatment and helps to anticipate the procurement of health care services and facilities, or more broadly: facilitates Advance Care Planning. Advance Care Planning improves the quality of the final phase of life by stimulating doctors to explore the preferences for end-of-life care with their patients, and people close to the patients. Physicians, however, tend to overestimate life expectancy, and miss the window of opportunity to initiate Advance Care Planning. Machine learning techniques offer a feasible and promising approach to predicting life expectancy. The research has potential for real-life applications, as in supporting timely recognition of the right moment to start Advance Care Planning.

The project will be made using IBM cloud's Watson Studio Service. Watson Studio will be used to not only make the model, which involves (preprocessing, model building and model evaluation), but also to deploy the model on the web. Node-Red will be used to link (or wire together) all the online services together.
